## Parameter Optimization of SVM
* SVM stands for Support Vector Machine.
* It is an supervised learning algorithm which is used for Classification as well as Regression problems. 
* Parameters of SVM such as kernel, C, and gamma can be changed in order to achieve a higher accuracy. This is called as Hyperparameter Tuning.

## Dataset
Name: EEG Eye State Data Set

Link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/EEG+Eye+State

Instances: 14980

Attributes: 15

## Methodology
1) Upload the multi-class dataset from UCI library. 
2) Divide the data into 70-30 for training and testing with 10 different samples.
3) Optimize SVM for each sample with 1000 iterations.
4) Report the best parameter with best accuracy and plot convergence graph.
